	water and then dump pasta into bowl with other ingredients.</li>
	<li>Before mixing, pour about half the bottle of Italian dressing evenly over the top of the pasta. Sprinkle desired amount of garlic powder and Italian 
	seasoning on top of dressing, and then sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese over the dressing.</li>
	<li>Stir ingredients in bowl together, ensuring dressing evenly coats all ingredients.</li>
