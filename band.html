<h2>Discography and Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>World Clique (1990)</b></li>
<p>This was the debut album for the group Deee-Lite and is what I consider 
their most simple album - in that it's purely about easy lyrics and good 
1990's dance music. Their most recognizable song, "Groove is in the Heart," comes 
	from this album, and helped launch them into international stardom.</p>
<li><b>Infinity Within (1992)</b></li>
<p>This album is unapologeticly political while still trying to be light-hearted 
enough to be popular on the dancefloor. "Vote, Baby, Vote" harkens back to MTV's
Rock the Vote campaigns, and the album touches on other political issues of the time 
such as global warming and safer sex. Though it is still "deee-liteful," it's my least 
favorite of their albums because it's too pushy and not as fun as their other 
	albums.</p>
<li><b>Dewdrops in the Garden (1994)</b></li>
<p>This album has a more retro sound to it than their first two albums, and when 
I first started exploring Deee-Lite's discography I thought this must have been their 
first album rather than their third, and last, studio album. The group was back to 
focusing on simpler themes in their music rather than the larger political scene. 
They never recaptured the success they saw with their first album, which was similar, 
but there are some great tracks on here that were popular in the underground dance scene.</p>
