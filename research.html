<h2>Dive Into PrEP Data.</h2>
<h3>PrEP Clinical Trials</h3>
<p>Prior to July 2012, there were three major clinical trials conducted that 
led to the eventual FDA approval of Truvada for use as HIV PrEP.</p>

<p><b>iPrEX</b><br>
iPrEX had the objective to "determine whether daily oral TDF/FTC 
(Truvada) can reduce the risk of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and 
transgender who also receive HIV counseling, condoms, and treatment for other STIs."
<br><br>
Details of iPrEX Study:<br>
<ul>
 <li>This study showed a high level of efficacy (92%) in study participants who took pills regularly 
but not as effective for study participants who were not adherent to treatment.</li>
 <li>There were 2,499 gay men, other men who have sex with men, and transgender women 
enrolled in the study.</li>
 <li>The study was conducted in six countries: Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, South 
Africa, Thailand, and the U.S.</li>

<p><b>TDF2</b><br>
TDF2 "tested whether daily TDF/FTC (Truvada) was safe for HIV-negative sexually-active young 
adults in Botswana and whether it reduced risk of HIV infection."
<br><br>
Details of the TDF2 Study:<br>
<ul>
 <li>This study showed a high level of efficacy (78%) for study participants who were adherent to 
 treatment but less efficacy for those who were not adherent.</li>
 <li>There were 1,219 HIV-negative heterosexual males and females enrolled in the study; the study 
 was conducted in Botswana.</li>

<p><b>Partners PrEP</b><br>
Partners PrEP had the objective to "demonstrate if PrEP decreases HIV-1 acquisition among HIV uninfected 
individuals within HIV-1 discordant couples." In other words, the study focused on couples where one partner 
had HIV and the other one was HIV-negative.
<br><br>
Details of the Partners PrEP Study:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Like the other two studies, this study showed a high level of efficacy (75%) when study participants 
 stuck with the treatment regimine.</li>
 <li>There were 4,758 study participants, or 2,379 HIV serodiscordant couples.</li>
 <li>The study was conducted in various locations in Kenya and Uganda.</li>
