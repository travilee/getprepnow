<h2>PrEP Works Best When Taken Daily.</h2>
<h3>You've got your PrEP prescription - How are YOU going to stay on top of taking it?</h3>
You're taking PrEP to protect yourself from getting HIV. Here's some suggestions to help you 
succeed.<br>
<p><b>Find ways to remind yourself to take it daily.</b></p>
Here's some ideas:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to take it daily. The alarm doesn't have to say something 
 obvious like "Take your PrEP!"; you can set it to say something less obvious such as "Smile, Sexy" or 
 whatever will help you remember.</li>
 <li>Use a pill reminder box. You can find an inexpensive one at any local drugstore or try asking your 
 doctor/clinician if they have any you can have for free.</li>
 <li>Take your pill at the same time every day. Think about other activities you do at the same time 
 every day - brushing your teeth, eating breakfast, or going to the gym - and incorporate taking PrEP 
 at that time.</li>
 <li>Use a calendar to mark off each day you take PrEP.</li>
 <li>Ask your friends what works best for them to remind them to take PrEP.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><b>Be PrEPared when you aren't at home or are travelling.</b></p>
Plan ahead for overnight visits and trips out of town:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Each month when you get your PrEP prescription, put a couple in a pill container you can keep in 
 a gym bag, book bag, or travel bag you generally have with you when you stay overnight with someone. That 
 way if you forget to bring some with you, you'll be ready. Don't take more than one pill within a 24-hour 
 period though.</li>
 <li>If you do travel and you forget your pills, check with your pharmacy and/or doctor/clinician to see if 
 you have any refills available. If you cannot get a refill and miss some days, use condoms when you have sex. 
 Remember, it is recommended that you still use condoms while you're on PrEP.</li>
 <li>It is not recommended that you take someone else's PrEP or Truvada.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><b>Go see your doctor/clinician at least every 3 months.</b></p>
Why you need to see your doctor/clinician regularly:<br>
<ul>
 <li>You need to be tested for HIV at least every 3 months. PrEP is not meant to be taken by people 
 who have HIV, and if you do happen to test HIV-positive, your doctor/clinican will want to start you 
 on a more effective treatment.</li>
 <li>If you've had condomless sex with a partner you aren't monogamous with, you need to be tested 
 for other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea and syphilis, regularly.</li>
 <li>Your doctor/clinician will need to regularly check on other bodily functions, such as kidney and 
 liver functions, especially if you are on PrEP long-term.</li>
</ul>
