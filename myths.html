<h2>There's a lot of misinformation out there.<br>Get the Facts Here.</h2>
<h3>Myth #1: PrEP causes crazy side effects.</h3>
<p>We've heard people talk about all kinds of weird side effects from taking PrEP, but
the truth of the matter is that most people experience very few side effects from taking 
the medication, and if they do experience them, the side effects usually go away after a short 
time being on the medication. Like any medication, the current medication used for PrEP, Truvada, 
does have some possible side effects. Take a look at <a href="https://start.truvada.com/side-effects"
 target="_blank">the Truvada website</a> for more information. It's important to keep 
your doctor/clinician aware of any side effects you experience once you start taking PrEP.</p>
<h3>Myth #2: If you use start using PrEP, you have to take it for the rest of 
your life.</h3>
<p>PrEP is meant to be taken during a time or times in your life when you are at an elevated risk 
for HIV infection. That means if your life circumstances change and you are no longer at an elevated 
risk, you can go off of PrEP after consulting with your doctor/clinician. And then if your life circumstances 
change again, you can go back on PrEP (as long as you are still HIV-negative).</p>
<h3>Myth #3: People who use PrEP are promiscuous and don't ever use condoms.</h3>
<p>Though a lot of people on PrEP report not using condoms 100% of the time, that doesn't mean everyone 
who is on PrEP has completely stopped using condoms. Just because someone goes on PrEP, it doesn't mean they 
start having a lot more sex than they did before they went on PrEP. Everyone's life circumstances are different,
 and it's more important to focus on the fact that the more people who get on PrEP who are at-risk for HIV 
infection, the better our chances are at lowering the high rates of HIV infection in our country and the world.</p>
<h3>Myth #4: If you are on PrEP long enough, you can build up resistance to 
the medication and eventually it won't protect you against HIV infection.</h3>
<p>For an HIV-positive person, not sticking to your anti-HIV medication treatment schedule (i.e. not taking your 
pills every day) can cause HIV to become resistant to the medication. There are a lot of concerns that people 
who take PrEP will also develop resistance to HIV if they aren't good about taking their pills every day. However, 
you have to have HIV in your body in the first place for the virus to become resistant to the medication.

<h3>Myth #5: Only rich gay men can afford PrEP.</h3>
<p>PrEP is expensive, especially if you have to pay for it completely out of pocket. However, there 
are some good programs available to make PrEP much more affordable. Even people who do not have insurance and 
have little to no income can be on PrEP. Check out this site's <a href="payment.html" target="_blank">
