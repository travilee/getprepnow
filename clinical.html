Getting PrEP requires a prescription from a doctor or other prescribing clinician. 
Here is some advice for seeing the doctor/clinician, getting labs drawn, and picking 
up your prescription from the pharmacy.<br>

<h3>The Doctor/Clinician</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Find someone who already prescribes PrEP. Visit <a href="https://preplocator.org 
target="blank">The PrEP Locator</a> to find a PrEP Provider.</li>
  <li>If there are no local clinicians available who already prescribe, or no one is 
in your insurance network, consider talking to your current doctor about PrEP. You 
may need to help your doctor learn about PrEP if he/she hasn't prescribed it to anyone 
else yet. Here's a couple of resources to help out:<br>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://start.truvada.com/hcp" target="_blank">Gilead's Truvada Provider's 
Page</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep" target="_blank">CDC's PrEP Resources for 
Providers</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

<h3>The Lab</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>The easiest option for labs is finding a doctor/clinic where labs are incorporated into 
the practice, meaning you do not have to go somewhere else for labs and your copay for the doctor/
clinic also covers the lab. Check with your doctor/clinic beforehand to see if this is the case.</li>
  <li>If you do have to visit the lab on a separate visit with a separate copay, determine how much 
your copay will be beforehand so you are prepared. Some labs will allow you to set up billing for the 
visit and allow you to make smaller payments over time.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>The Pharmacy</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Consider an HIV-specialty pharmacy. Since Truvada is also used for HIV treatment,
 if you go to an HIV-specialty pharmacy you are guaranteed they'll be able to fill your
 prescription and will know how to work with any payment assistance programs you might be
 using. Use your preferred internet search engine to find one close to you.</li>
 <li>Think about location. Even if you can't find a local HIV-specialty pharmacy, consider
 using a pharmacy you can access when you travel out of town. That way if you forget your
 prescription at home, you might be able to get a refill while travelling.</li>
 <li>If you're not using any payment assistance programs, all you have to 
 consider at the pharmacy is whether they generally have Truvada on hand. If 
 they do, you can use the same pharmacy you use for other prescriptions.</li>
</ul>
