  <h2>Travis Barnhart and the Good Samaritan Project</h2>
  
  <p>Hello, my name is Travis Barnhart. I'm a social worker and I currently 
  serve as the Director of Prevention at Good Samaritan Project in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
  <p>Good Samaritan Project is Kansas City's longest-running HIV/AIDS service 
  organization. Our agency started in 1985 in response to the AIDS crisis. Over our 35+ years 
  of existence we've grown and changed with the shifts in the HIV/AIDS epidemic and today 
  we provide a comprehensive set of services including HIV case management and HIV and STD 
  (sexually transmitted diseases) testing and prevention.</p>
  <p>I have been working in the HIV and sexual health field since 1999 when I first 
  started volunteering and then working at a local AIDS Service Organization. I also worked 
  at Planned Parenthood, a state health department, and the Kansas City CARE Clinic prior 
  to joining the staff at Good Samaritan Project in 2014. I currently lead the Kansas City 
  PrEP Task Force through the Kansas City Health Department's Ryan White Planning Council.</p>
  <p>You can learn more about me and the Good Samaritan Project (GSP) 
  by visiting GSP's <a href="https://www.gsp-kc.org" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
